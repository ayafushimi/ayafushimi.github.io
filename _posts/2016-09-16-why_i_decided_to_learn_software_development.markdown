To explain why, I'll look back changes of how I think about programming. 
(Since I'm Japanese, there may be some grammatical mistakes... Sorry about that in advance.)

## Before graduating from university
I didn't know what exactly programming was in my university days, moreover didn’t  have any interest in it.
In Japan, the common image of programmers is that they have to work continuously without sleep for many days to meet the deadline. So it never came up in my mind to become a programmer when I was looking for my first job.

## Recognizing "WEB APPLICATION"
After I got used to my first job, one of my seniors in my university asked me to introduce a person who is interested in joining a venture company if I knew one. He said he was looking for new colleagues to launch a new big project to make a web application in his company. The web application was planned to include an artificial intelligence and suggest automatically how to improve websites. 

At this point, I didn't know what "web application" was, but I was very interested in that project to make an AI application, so I decided to join that company.

## Knowing how to make WEBSITES
To build such an application that makes websites better, I had to learn, first of all, how to create awesome websites. I did many projects as a web consultant to produce better websites with designers, coders and programmers, studying how to make the best use of Google Analytics, how to code websites, how to add moves to websites, etc.

Since my work was making contents and outlines of websites, I was not in charge of designing and coding actually. But I thought that it was better to be able to read codes to make good feedbacks, so I studied html/css/javascript by myself and in study groups.

## Providing our WEB APPLICATION SERVICE 
As I worked projects, we also built the web application, and finally was able to release our product, named as "AI Analyst".
I was assigned as a manager of sales, so I met many customers of our product and got a lot of feedbacks from them. Of course, I relayed the feedbacks to our programming team, and then they improved our application better and better. In this process, I got the desire to be more involved in developing our application. This was the moment that I decided to be a programmer.

## After deciding to be a programmer
I kept studying javascript by myself  even before I decided to be a programmer, but it seemed a little bit difficult to be a professional programmer with this learning process, I thought. Then I started to search for a school where I can study both of front-end and back-end in javascript (because our application is all written in javascript). Eventually, I found the school and got admitted there. I was about to start the lessons at the school in April. However my husband was suddenly transferred to NY from Tokyo. It was very hard decision for me, but I made up my mind to follow him. So I gave up to enter the school.

## Learning programing in a foreign language
After moving to NY, I started looking for a school again. I found several schools, and took pre-courses to determine where to enter. And now, I'm studying at Flatiron School. 

Learning programming in English is a very hard for me, but it’s worth challenging. I'd like to get a new job here because advanced technologies, including newest method in programming or new programmed products, are always invented here in the US and I really love newest thing. So, I feel like I need to be more fluent in both programming language and English for me to understand these deeply.

Now I'm grateful to my husband for giving me this chance.
